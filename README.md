```
### Platforms Supported
The script checks the username on the following platforms:

Discord

### Error Handling
Twitch: The script checks the specific error message returned by Twitch if the username doesn't exist.
Discord: The script handles the invalid invite error message and informs the user if the username is not associated with an invite.

### Customization
To add or remove platforms, simply modify the apps list within the script by adding or removing URLs with the appropriate format.

## Notes
The script simulates a browser request by using a User-Agent header. This helps avoid being blocked by some platforms.
It checks the username by making GET requests and verifies the presence of the username based on the platformâ€™s HTTP response or error messages.
